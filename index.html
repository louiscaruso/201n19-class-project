      I graduated from high school in 2012 and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served five years honorably, achieving the rank of Cpl. Receiving an honorable discharge I used my education benefits to pursue a few different career options. I have found through those different career paths that I am most happy when given the chance to use my creativity and problem-solving skills, I am very much an analytic thinker. This is my first exposer to the tech industry, but I am passionate about the opportunity to use my skills and see where the future may take me.

        My current goals are to achieve a stable career that will give me a good work/life balance. While serving I was fortunate to see unique cultures and countries, not all great, but I still feel it was a significant opportunity. Now I hope a career like software development will give me the chance to see the rest of the world.
